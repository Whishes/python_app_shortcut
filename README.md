# python_app_shortcut

## To use correctly:

1. Clone the repo/file to your designated folder
   or if you already have the file downloaded, just place it in the folder you wish to have your project in.

2. (OPTIONAL) If you wish to install multiple packages (eg. Flask and psycopg2 etc), create a file called `install.txt` and within it place each package on its own line. 
An example being if you wanted just Flask and psycopg2:
   > Flask
   >
   > psycopg2

3. In your folder's terminal - run `python3 shortcut.py` or whatever equivalent may work on your machine.
